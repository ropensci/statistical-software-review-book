# Standards {#standards}

An important output of the present project is a set of standards which can
serve as expectations for software and as guides against which developers and
reviewers can assess software. Important general questions regarding standards
include the following:

-   What kind of standards might apply to software in general?

-   How might such standards differ between different languages?

-   What kind of standards might specifically apply to statistical software?

-   To what extent should we aim for "verification" or "validation" of
  software, and how might be signify such?

We acknowledge that standards of the kind anticipated here will likely be better
conceived of to reflect ongoing processes of development. As such, of equal
importance to developing a set of standards *per se* will be developing an
understanding of the kinds of *processes* which may have the most defining
effect on resultant standards at any point in time.

The remainder of this document employs a convenient distinction between:

-   "*General Standards*" which may be applied to all software considered within
    this project, irrespective of how it may be categorized under the times of
    categories of statistical software listed above; and

-   "*Specific Standards*" which apply to different degrees to statistical
    software depending on the software category.

It is likely that standards developed under the first category may subsequently
be deemed to be genuinely *Statistical Standards* yet which are applicable
across all categories, and it may also be likely that the development of
category-specific standards reveals aspects which are common across all
categories, and which may subsequently be deemed general standards. We
accordingly anticipate a degree of fluidity between these two broad categories.

There is also a necessary relationship between the Standards described here,
and processes of Assessment described below in [Chapter 8](#assessment). We
consider the latter to describe concrete *and generally quantitative* aspects
of *post hoc* software assessment, while the present Standards provides guides
and benchmarks against which to *prospectively* compare software during
development. As this entire document is intended to serve as the defining
reference for our Standards, that term may in turn be interpreted to reflect
this entire document, with the current section explicitly describing aspects of
Standards not covered elsewhere.

As described above, we anticipate the ongoing development of this current
document to employ a versioning system, with software reviewed and hosted under
the system mandated to flag the latest version of these standards to which it
complies.

## Other Standards

Among the noteworthy instances of software standards which might be adapted for
our purposes, and in addition to entries in our [*Annotated
Bibliography*](#reading), the following are particularly relevant:

1. The [Core Infrastructure Initiative's Best Practices
   Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en), which is granted to
   software meeting an extensive list of
   [criteria](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md).
   This list of criteria provides a singularly useful reference for software
   standards.
2. The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)'s
   [*Software Evaulation
   Guide*](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything/software-evaluation-guide),
   in particular their guide to [*Criteria-based software
   evaluation*](http://software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/SSI-SoftwareEvaluationCriteria.pdf),
   which considers two primary categories of *Usability* and *Sustainability
   and Maintainability*, each of which is divided into numerous sub-categories.
   The guide identifies numerous concrete criteria for each sub-category.
3. The more technical considerations of the [Object Management
   Group](https://www.omg.org/index.htm)'s [*Automated Source Code CISQ
   Maintainability Measure*](https://www.omg.org/spec/ASCMM/) (where CISQ
   refers to the [*Consortium for IT Software
   Quality*](https://www.it-cisq.org/)). This guide describes a number of
   measures which can be readily automatically extracted and used to quantify
   the maintainability of source code. None of these measures are not already
   considered in one or both of the preceding two documents, but the
   identification here of those particularly amenable to automated assessment
   is likely to provide a useful reference.

There is also rOpenSci's guide on [package development, maintenance, and peer
review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/), which provides standards of this type
for R packages, primarily within its first chapter. Another notable example is
the [tidyverse design guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/), and the
section on [Conventions for R Modeling
Pacakges](https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/) which
provides guidance for model-fitting APIs.

  guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/out-type-stability.html).)


### Documentation

Standards will include requirements for form and completeness of documentation.
As with interface, several sources already provide starting points for
reasonable documentation. Some documentation requirements will be specific to
the statistical context. For instance, it is likely we will have requirements
for referencing appropriate literature or references for theoretical support of
implementations. Another area of importance is correctness and clarity of
definitions of statistical quantities produced by the software, e.g., the
definition of null hypotheses or confidence intervals. Data included in
software -- that used in examples or tests -- will also have documentation
requirements. It is worth noting that the
[`roxygen`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) system for documenting R packages is
readily extensible, as exemplified through the [`roxytest`
package](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytest) for specifying tests *in-line*.

An additional area for consideration is the creation of tools for documentation
creation and evaluation based on metadata of statistical method inputs and
outputs and packaged data [@lenhardt_data_2014]. Relationships between data
and statistical software may be structured in a sufficiently systematic way to
permit systematic documentation.

### Testing {#overview-testing}

Testing is a critical area for standards, as tests are a concrete manifestation
of standards and the means by which authors may demonstrate compliance. While
testing is considered best practice and test coverage often used as a measure of
test completeness, guidance on *what* to test is rare, especially in the context
of R packages. Thus, standards will need to provide guidance on the types and
methods of tests required for different statistical software categories.

In addition, statistical software may benefit from means or modes of testing
beyond the common frameworks used in and for R packages (e.g. R RMD check,
testhtat). A variety of other frameworks and workflows from other languages and
contexts may be relevant. Almost all testing as currently implemented in R is
"concrete testing" (Mili 2015), and little consideration has been given in R to
"stochastic" or "property-based" testing, in which expectation values of inputs
and outputs are tested, rather than concrete instantiations of such (the
notably exception of the apparently abandoned [`fuzzr`
package](https://github.com/mdlincoln/fuzzr) notwithstanding). Other languages
have developed grammars for stochastic or property-based testing, notably
through the [hypothesis package for
python](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis). These grammars enable
specification of test assumptions as well as expected test outputs. Assumptions
in `hypothesis` are declared through simple `@given` statements that might, for
example, quantify an assumed probability distribution for input data, while
outputs are specified through equivalent `@expect` statements that might, for
example, specify expected *distributional properties* of an output rather than
just concrete values.

The following are likely key questions which we will need to address regarding
testing:

-   To what extent should testing focus on *functional* or *integration* rather
    than *unit* testing?

-   Is it sufficient to consider test execution as an integral part of
    `R CMD check` only? Or might there by a case for developing alternative test
    execution environments and approaches? For instance, should there be an
    alternate workflow for long-running tests, tests requiring large data, or
    tests intended to be executed for other purposes?

-   Is it worthwhile concretely defining one or more goals of testing? (Such as
    error detection, error frequencies, error tolerance, accuracy.)

-   What are the test data? And how easy is it to input alternative data to
    tests?

-   Is there scope for "stochastic" or "property-based" testing?

-   What test reporter should be used? Does the `testthat` package and similar
    suffice? Or might it be worth considering new test reporting systems?

-   What aspects of tests and test data (both actual and permissible) might be
    worthwhile documenting in some kind of metadata format?

Extant R package which address some of these issues include
[`tinytest`](https://github.com/markvanderloo/tinytest),
[`roxytest`](https://github.com/mikldk/roxytest), and
[`xpectr`](https://github.com/LudvigOlsen/xpectr).

The "Turing Way" has a useful discussion of [different kinds of software
tests](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/testing/testing.html).


## Standards Specific to Statistical Software

Software must specify its area of validity through specifying the specific
statistical categories.

The applicability of any concrete set of standards is likely to differ between
different categories of statistical software. For example, metrics of numerical
accuracy will likely differ between categories primarily describing analytical
algorithms and those describing less tractable routines which produce less
directly reproducible results. Or consider metrics derived from tests, which
must be interpreted in *qualitatively* different ways for packages entirely
dependent on their own internal code versus packages largely dependent on the
results of calls to external data providers (along with additional differences
between, for example, locally-installed "external" providers versus online
sources of external data).

Different standards must thus be considered to be differentially applicable to
different categories of software, and thus the interplay between the scope of
statistical software considered above and throughout this project, and the
standards emerging from the project, will be of critical importance throughout
the project. Such considerations lead to the following kinds of questions which
will likely have to be addressed:

-   To what extent ought we aim for general standards at the expense of specific
    abilities to assess particular categories of statistical software?

-   To what extent ought we strive for automation of software assessment, given
    the inherent risk of overseeing qualitative differences between different
    categories?

-   How much effort should be expended both developing a categorization of
    statistical software, and understanding the potential effects of such a
    categorization?

The following exemplify a few categories of statistical standards which may be
considered, emphasising restrictions of applicability to alternative kinds of
software.

-   **Numerical standards such as precision or convergence.** These will be
    applicable only to some restricted subset of all potential categories of
    statistical software (likely including but not limited to analytic and, to
    some extent, predictive routines) Moreover, even these two categories alone
    will likely require differing standards for precision or convergence.

-   **Method validity** It may be necessary or useful to develop standards for
    the *validity* of a chosen method, independent of its implementation.
    Questions of validity are commonly related to domains of application, and
    therefore must relate directly to any system for categorising statistical
    software. A method may (have been demonstrated to) be valid for some
    particular domain of application, and a software routine may be developed to
    adapt that method to some previously untried domain. It may then be
    necessary to consider potential (in)validity of that software, along with
    potential validity in other domains, themselves potentially not explicitly
    considered by the software authors.

-   **Software scope** The preceding considerations extend directly to general
    concerns of *scope*, whether in terms of domains of applicability,
    properties of input or output data, authorial intentions, or other
    contextual factors. Scope in all of these senses obviously must directly
    affect and determine the kinds of standards which may or may not apply to
    software, just as defining scope in these senses is also effectively an
    exercise in categorization of the kind described above.

-   **Reference standards** For software which implements or relies on standard
    routines, it may be necessary to designate reference data or
    implementations against which to compare outcomes, or guidance in selecting
    such references. For instance, the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology of the U.S. provides [a collection of reference data
    sets](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/) with certified computational
    results which statistical software should be able to reproduce.

Specific standards for neural network algorithms have been developed as part of
a [google 2019 Summer Of Code project](http://www.inmodelia.com/gsoc2019.html),
resulting in a dedicated R package,
[`NNbenchmark`](https://akshajverma.com/NNbenchmarkWeb/index.html), and
accompanying results---their so-called
["notebooks"](https://akshajverma.com/NNbenchmarkWeb/notebooks.html)---of
applying their benchmarks to a suite of neural network packages.

We envision the present project proceeding from this initial stage by
developing parallel definitions for both categories of software (defining both
*in*-scope and *beyond*-scope), and specific standards. A simple way to
proceed may be to develop lists for both, along with a representation of
inter-connections between categories and standards.
