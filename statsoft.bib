Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists. The Turing Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do".

Interestingly, open-source communities lack guidelines on how to manage authorship. This could be mitigated by setting to build an empirical body of knowledge on how authorship-related measures evolve in successful open-source communities. Towards that direction, we perform a case study on the Linux kernel. Our results show that: (a) only a small portion of developers (26\%) makes significant contributions to the code base; (b) the distribution of the number of files per author is highly skewed—a small group of top-authors (3\%) is responsible for hundreds of files, while most authors (75\%) are responsible for at most 11 files; (c) most authors (62\%) have a specialist profile; (d) authors with a high number of co-authorship connections tend to collaborate with others with less connections.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118},
	abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This "double descent" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses, and has implications for both the theory and practice of machine learning.},

We have identified community-specific programming style variations. For example, there are programming communities which do not use snake\_case at all. A consensus in programming style is forming. We have summarised it into a \_Consensus-based Style\_.},

Identifying improvements for science software sustainability practices can contribute to the re-use of science software. A focus group study was conducted to identify ways to improve science software sustainability practices of the Earth science community. A facilitated, roundtable discussion activity at the 2014 Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Summer Meeting elicited recommendations on community activities to improve practices for the sustainability of scientific software. These suggestions fell into three broad themes – (1) improving collaboration and community engagement through publications and presentations (2) developing workshops, training, and documenting best practices and (3) creating incentives and motivation with awards, citation and a reviewed software repository. In addition to the recommendations coming out of the roundtable activity, this paper highlights how community-led groups such as ESIP are key to move a sustainable software effort in its various forms from concept to reality.},

	abstract = {Currently there is no standard way to identify how a dataset was created, and what characteristics, motivations, and potential skews it represents. To begin to address this issue, we propose the concept of a datasheet for datasets, a short document to accompany public datasets, commercial APIs, and pretrained models. The goal of this proposal is to enable better communication between dataset creators and users, and help the AI community move toward greater transparency and accountability. By analogy, in computer hardware, it has become industry standard to accompany everything from the simplest components (e.g., resistors), to the most complex microprocessor chips, with datasheets detailing standard operating characteristics, test results, recommended usage, and other information. We outline some of the questions a datasheet for datasets should answer. These questions focus on when, where, and how the training data was gathered, its recommended use cases, and, in the case of human-centric datasets, information regarding the subjects' demographics and consent as applicable. We develop prototypes of datasheets for two well-known datasets: Labeled Faces in The Wild and the Pang {\textbackslash}\& Lee Polarity Dataset.},

An ecosystem consists of a core platform and a halo of user contributions that provide value to a company or project. In order to sustain the level and number of high-quality contributions, it is crucial for companies and contributors to understand how ecosystems tend to evolve and can be maintained successfully over time. As a first step, this paper explores the evolution characteristics of the statistical computing project GNU R, which is a successful, end-user programming ecosystem. We find that the ecosystem of user-contributed R packages has been growing steadily since R's conception, at a significantly faster rate than core packages, yet each individual package remains stable in size. We also identified differences in the way user-contributed and core packages are able to attract an active community of users.},

The tips point to practices that save time and increase the accuracy and reliability of automated test techniques. Techniques that play well during demos of testing tools often are not the optimal techniques to apply on a running project. This book highlights those differences, helping you apply techniques that are repeatable and callable in professionally run software development projects. Emphasis is placed on creating tests that, while automated, are easily adapted as the software under construction evolves toward its final form. Techniques in the book are arranged into five categories: scripting, testing, the environment, running and logging of tests, and reviewing of the results. Every automation engineer sooner or later will face similar issues to the ones covered in these categories, and you will benefit from the simple and clear answers provided in this book. While the focus of the book is on the use of automated tools, the tips are not specific to any one vendor solution. The tips cover general issues that are faced no matter the specific tool, and are broadly applicable, often even to manual testing efforts. What You'll Learn: Employ best-practices in automated test design Write test scripts that will easily be understood by others Choose the proper environment for running automated tests Avoid techniques that demo well, but do not scale in practice Manage tests effectively, including testing of test scripts themselves Know when to go beyond automation to employ manual methods instead.},

	abstract = {Here's the first book written specifically to help medical device and software engineers, QA and compliance professionals, and corporate business managers better understand and implement critical verification and validation processes for medical device software. Offering you a much broader, higher-level picture than other books in this field, this book helps you think critically about software validation -- to build confidence in your software's safety and effectiveness. The book presents validation activities for each phase of the development lifecycle and shows: why these activities are important and add value; how to undertake them; and what outputs need to be created to document the validation process. From software embedded within medical devices, to software that performs as a medical device itself, this comprehensive book explains how properly handled validation throughout the development lifecycle can help bring medical devices to completion sooner, at higher quality, and in compliance with regulations. Additionally, an entire part of the book is devoted to the validation of software that automates any part of a manufacturer's quality system and is regulated by 21 CFR 820.70(i). DVD Included! Contains a collection of FDA regulations and guidance documents related to software in the medical device industry, valuable sample forms and templates, and supplemental figures that support key topics covered in the book.},

	abstract = {The World is lacking an in-depth technical book describing the methods and techniques used to provide confidence in our system software. Not only is the U.S. government more focused on software safety in today's market, but private industry and academia are as well. The methods and techniques that provide such confidence are commonly called software verification and validation. Software Verification and Validation: An Engineering and Scientific Approach, a professional book, fills the critical need for an in-depth technical reference providing the methods and techniques for building and maintaining confidence in many varieties of system software. The intent of this volume is to help develop reliable answers to such critical questions as: 1) Are we building the right software for the need? 2) Are we building the software right? Software Verification and Validation: An Engineering and Scientific Approach is structured for research scientists and practitioners in industry. This book is also suitable as a secondary textbook for advanced-level students in computer science and engineering.},

The EUREX project analyzed the industrial and economic impact and the common aspects and differences between and among more than 300 Software Process Improvement Experiments sponsored by the EU. The current volume offers a variety of perspectives on software quality issues resulting from that analysis, including testing, verification and validation. This area represents one of the "great unknowns" in software development in the sense that many organisations, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, have no purposeful process addressing these issues. As a result, this book is particularly meaningful for software practitioners in such enterprises, including both developers and line managers.},

Describe the program development process in terms of operations, and define exit criteria which must be satisfied for completion of each operation. 2. Separate the objectives of the inspection process operations to keep the inspection team focused on one objective at a time: Operation Overview Preparation Inspection Rework Follow-up Objective Communications/education Education Find errors Fix errors Ensure all fixes are applied correctly 3. Classify errors by type, and rank frequency of occurrence of types. Identify which types to spend most time looking for in the inspection. 4. Describe how to look for presence of error types. 5. Analyze inspection results and use for constant process improvement (until process averages are reached and then use for process control).},
