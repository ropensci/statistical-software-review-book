## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploration is a part of all data analyses, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
is not something that is entered into and exited from at some point prior to
"real" analysis. Exploratory Analyses are also not strictly limited to *Data*,
but may extend to exploration of *Models* of those data. The category could
thus equally be termed, "*Exploratory Data and Model Analysis*", yet we opt to
utilise the standard acronym of EDA in this document.

EDA is nevertheless somewhat different to many other categories included within
rOpenSci's program for peer-reviewing statistical software. Primary differences include:

- EDA software often has a strong focus upon visualization, which is a category
  which we have otherwise explicitly excluded from the scope of the project at
  the present stage.
- The assessment of EDA software requires addressing more general questions
  than software in most other categories, notably including the important
  question of intended audience(s).

The following standards are accordingly somewhat differently structured than
equivalent standards developed to date for other categories, particularly
through being more qualitative and abstract. In particular, while documentation
is an important component of standards for all categories, clear and
instructive documentation is of paramount importance for EDA Software, and so
warrants its own sub-section within this document.

### Documentation Standards

The following refer to *Primary Documentation*, implying in main package
`README` or vignette(s), and *Secondary Documentation*, implying function-level
documentation.

The *Primary Documentation* (`README` and/or vignette(s)) of EDA software
should:

- **EA1.0** *Identify one or more target audiences for whom the software is intended*
- **EA1.1** *Identify the kinds of data the software is capable of analysing (see
  *Kinds of Data* below).*
- **EA1.2** *Identify the kinds of questions the software is intended to help
  explore; for example, are these questions:*
    - *inferential?*
    - *predictive?*
    - *associative?*
    - *causal?*
    - *(or other modes of statistical enquiry?)*

The *Secondary Documentation* (within individual functions) of EDA software
should:

- **EA1.3** *Identify the kinds of data each function is intended to accept as input*

### Input Data

A further primary difference of EDA software from that of our other categories
is that input data for statistical software may be generally presumed of one or
more specific types, whereas EDA software often accepts data of more general
and varied types. EDA software should aim to accept and appropriately transform
as many diverse kinds of input data as possible, through addressing the
following standards, considered in terms of the two cases of input data in uni-
and multi-variate form. All of the general standards for kinds of input (G2.0 -
G2.7) apply to input data for EDA Software.

#### Index Columns

The following standards refer to an *index column*, which is understood to
imply an explicitly named or identified column which can be used to provide a
unique index index into any and all rows of that table. Index columns ensure
the universal applicability of standard table join operations, such as those
implemented via the [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org).

- **EA2.0** *EDA Software which accepts standard tabular data and implements or
  relies upon extensive table filter and join operations should utilise an
  **index column** system*
- **EA2.1** *All values in an index column must be unique, and this uniqueness
  should be affirmed as a pre-processing step for all input data.*
- **EA2.2** *Index columns should be explicitly identified, either:*
    - **EA2.2a** *by using an appropriate class system, or*
    - **EA2.2b** *through setting an `attribute` on a table, `x`, of `attr(x, "index") <- <index_col_name>`.*

For EDA software which either implements custom classes or explicitly sets
attributes specifying index columns, these attributes should be used as the
basis of all table join operations, and in particular:

- **EA2.3** *Table join operations should not be based on any assumed variable or
  column names*

#### Multi-tabular input

EDA software designed to accept multi-tabular input should:

- **EA2.4** *Use and demand an explicit class system for such input (for example,
  via the [`DM` package](https://github.com/krlmlr/dm)).*
- **EA2.5** *Ensure all individual tables follow the above standards for Index Columns*

#### Classes and Sub-Classes

*Classes* are understood here to be the classes define single input objects,
while *Sub-Classes* refer to the class definitions of components of input
objects (for example, of columns of an input `data.frame`). EDA software which
is intended to receive input in general vector formats (see *Uni-variate Input*
section of *General Standards*) should ensure:

- **EA2.6** *Routines appropriately process vector input of custom classes,
  including those which do not inherit from the `vector` class*
- **EA2.7** *Routines should appropriately process vector data regardless of
  additional attributes*

The following code illustrates some ways by which "metadata" defining classes
and additional attributes associated with a standard vector object may by
modified.

``` r
x <- 1:10
class (x) <- "notvector"
attr (x, "extra_attribute") <- "another attribute"
attr (x, "vector attribute") <- runif (5)
attributes (x)
#> $class
#> [1] "notvector"
#> 
#> $extra_attribute
#> [1] "another attribute"
#> 
#> $`vector attribute`
#> [1] 0.03521663 0.49418081 0.60129563 0.75804346 0.16073301
```

All statistical software should appropriately deal with such input
data, as exemplified by the `storage.mode()`, `length()`, and `sum()` functions
of the `base` package, which return the appropriate values regardless of
redefinition of class or additional attributes.

``` r
storage.mode (x)
#> [1] "integer"
length (x)
#> [1] 10
sum (x)
#> [1] 55
storage.mode (sum (x))
#> [1] "integer"
```

Tabular inputs in `data.frame` class may contain columns which are
themselves defined by custom classes, and which possess additional attributes.
EDA Software which accepts tabular inputs should accordingly ensure:

- **EA2.8** *EDA routines appropriately process tabular input of custom classes,
  ideally by means of a single pre-processing routine which converts
  tabular input to some standard form subsequently passed to all analytic
  routines.*
- **EA2.9** *EDA routines accept and appropriately process tabular input in
  which individual columns may be of custom sub-classes including additional
  attributes.*


### Analytic Algorithms

(There are no specific standards for analytic algorithms in EDA Software.)

### Return Results / Output Data

- **EA4.0** *EDA Software should ensure all return results have types which are
  consistent with input types. For example, `sum`, `min`, or `max` values
  applied to `integer`-type vectors should return `integer` values, while
  `mean` or `var` will generally return `numeric` types.*
- **EA4.1** *EDA Software should implement parameters to enable explicit control
  of numeric precision*
- **EA4.2** *The primary routines of EDA Software should return objects for which
  default `print` and `plot` methods give sensible results. Default `summary`
  methods may also be implemented.*

### Visualization and Summary Output

Visualization commonly represents one of the primary functions of EDA Software,
and thus visualization output is given greater consideration in this category
than in other categories in which visualization may nevertheless play an
important role. In particular, one component of this sub-category is *Summary
Output*, taken to refer to all forms of screen-based output beyond conventional
graphical output, including tabular and other text-based forms. Standards for
visualization itself are considered in the two primary sub-categories of static
and dynamic visualization, where the latter includes interactive visualization.

Prior to these individual sub-categories, we consider a few standards
applicable to visualization in general, whether static or dynamic.

- **EA5.0** *Graphical presentation in EDA software should be as accessible as
  possible or practicable. In particular, EDA software should consider
  accessibility in terms of:*
    - **EA5.0a** *Typeface sizes should default to sizes which explicitly enhance      accessibility
    - **EA5.0b** Default colour schemes should be carefully constructed to ensure accessibility.*
- **EA5.1** *Any explicit specifications of typefaces which override default values
  should consider accessibility*

#### Summary and Screen-based Output

- **EA5.2** *Screen-based output should never rely on default print formatting of
  `numeric` types, rather should also use some version of `round(., digits)`,
  `formatC`, `sprintf`, or similar functions for numeric formatting according
  the parameter described in EDA4.2.*
- **EA5.3** *Column-based summary statistics should always indicate the
  `storage.mode`, `class`, or equivalent defining attribute of each column (as,
  for example, implemented in the default `print.tibble` method).*

#### General Standards for Visualization (Static and Dynamic)

- **EA5.4** *All visualisations should include units on all axes, with sensibly
  rounded values (for example, as produced by the `pretty()` function).*

#### Dynamic Visualization

Dynamic visualization routines are commonly implemented as interfaces to
`javascript` routines. Unless routines have been explicitly developed as an
internal part of an R package, standards shall not be considered to apply to
the code itself, rather only to decisions present as user-controlled parameters
exposed within the R environment. That said, one standard may nevertheless be
applied, with an aim to minimise 

- **EA5.5** *Any packages which internally bundle libraries used for dynamic
  visualization and which are also bundled in other, pre-existing R packages,
  should explain the necessity and advantage of re-bundling that library.*

### Testing

#### Return Values

- **EA6.0** Return values from all functions should be tested, including tests
  for the following characteristics:
    - **EA6.0a** Classes and types of objects
    - **EA6.0b** Dimensions of tabular objects
    - **EA6.0c** Column names (or equivalent) of tabular objects
    - **EA6.0d** Classes or types of all columns contained within
      `data.frame`-type tabular objects 
    - **EA6.0e** Values of single-valued objects; for `numeric` values either
      using `testthat::expect_equal()` or equivalent with a defined value for
      the `tolerance` parameter, or using `round(..., digits = x)` with some
      defined value of `x` prior to testing equality.

#### Graphical Output

- **EA6.1** The properties of graphical output from EDA software should be
  explicitly tested, for example via the [`vdiffr`
  package](https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr) or equivalent.

Tests for graphical output are frequently only run as part of an extended test
suite.
