## Bayesian and Monte Carlo Software {#standards-bayesian}

Bayesian and Monte Carlo software centres on quantitative estimation of
components of [Baye's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem),
particularly on estimation or application of prior and/or posterior probability
distributions. The procedures implemented to estimate the properties of such
distributions are commonly based on random sampling procedures, hence referred
to as "*Monte Carlo*" routines in reference to the random yet quantifiable
nature of casino games. The scope of this category also includes algorithms
which focus on sampling routines only, such as Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
procedures, independent of application in Bayesian analyses.

The term "model" is understood with reference here to Bayesian software to
refer to an encoded description of how parameters specifying aspects of one or
more prior distributions are transformed into (properties of) one or more
posterior distributions.

Some examples of Bayesian and Monte Carlo software include:

1. The [`dynamite` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/dynamite/), which is an
   interface for Bayesian inference of complex panel (time series) data comprising 
   of multiple measurements per multiple individuals.
2. The [`brms` package](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/), which is an interface for
   fitting Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models.
3. The [`GammaGompertzCR`
   package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00216), which allows
   estimating survival in free-ranging animal populations using Bayesian models.
4. The [`BayesianNetwork`
   package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00425), which is in
   many ways a wrapper package primarily serving a `shiny` app, and is also
   accordingly a package in the EDA category.
5. The [`fmcmc` package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01427),
   which is a "classic" MCMC package which directly provides its own
   implementation, and generates its own convergence statistics.
6. The [`walkr` package](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00061) for
   "MCMC Sampling from Non-Negative Convex Polytopes". This package is also
   indicative of the difficulties of deriving generally applicable assessments
   of software in this category, because MCMC *sampling* relies on
   fundamentally different inputs and outputs than many other MCMC routines.

Click on the following link to view a demonstration [Application of Bayesian
and Monte Carlo Standards](https://hackmd.io/zVWTAl9ZQeCcj_bvMGcmMQ).

Bayesian and Monte Carlo Software (hereafter referred to for simplicity as
"Bayesian Software") is presumed to perform one or more of the following steps:

1. Document how to specify inputs including:
    - 1.1 Data
    - 1.2 Parameters determining prior distributions
    - 1.3 Parameters determining the computational processes
2. Accept and validate all of forms of input
3. Apply data transformation and pre-processing steps
4. Apply one or more analytic algorithms, generally sampling algorithms used to
   generate estimates of posterior distributions
5. Return the result of that algorithmic application
6. Offer additional functionality such as printing or summarising return results

This chapter details standards for each of these steps, each prefixed with "BS".

### Documentation of Inputs

Prior to actual standards for documentation of inputs, we note one
terminological standard for Bayesian software which uses the term
"hyperparameter":

- [**BS1.0**]{#BS1_0} *Bayesian software which uses the term "hyperparameter"
  should explicitly clarify the meaning of that term in the context of that
  software.*

This standard reflects the dual facts that this term is frequently used in
Bayesian software, yet has no unambiguous definition or interpretation. The
term "hyperparameter" is also used in other statistical contexts in ways that
are often distinctly different from its common use in Bayesian analyses. Examples of the kinds of clarifications required to adhere to this standard include,

> Hyperparameters refer here to parameters determining the form of prior
distributions that conditionally depend on other parameters.

Such a clarification would then require further explicit distinction between
"parameters" and "hyperparameters". The remainder of these standards does not
refer to "hyperparameters", rather attempts to make explicit distinctions
between different kinds of parameters, such as distributional or algorithmic
control parameters. Beyond this standard, Bayesian Software should provide the
following documentation of how to specify inputs:

- [**BS1.1**]{#BS1_1} *Descriptions of how to enter data, both in textual form
  and via code examples. Both of these should consider the simplest cases of
  single objects representing independent and dependent data, and potentially
  more complicated cases of multiple independent data inputs.*
- [**BS1.2**]{#BS1_2} *Description of how to specify prior distributions, both
  in textual form describing the general principles of specifying prior 
  distributions, along with more applied descriptions and examples, within:*
    - [**BS1.2a**]{#BS1_2a} *The main package `README`, either as textual
      description or example code* 
    - [**BS1.2b**]{#BS1_2b} *At least one package vignette, both as general and 
      applied textual descriptions, and example code* 
    - [**BS1.2c**]{#BS1_2c} *Function-level documentation, preferably with code 
      included in examples* 
- [**BS1.3**]{#BS1_3} *Description of all parameters which control the 
  computational process (typically those determining aspects such as 
  numbers and lengths of sampling processes,
  seeds used to start them, thinning parameters determining post-hoc
  sampling from simulated values, and convergence criteria). In
  particular:*
    - [**BS1.3a**]{#BS1_3a} *Bayesian Software should document, both in text
      and examples, how to use the output of previous simulations as starting
      points of subsequent simulations.* 
    - [**BS1.3b**]{#BS1_3b} *Where
      applicable, Bayesian software should document, both in text and examples,
      how to use different sampling algorithms for a given model.*
- [**BS1.4**]{#BS1_4} *For Bayesian Software which implements or otherwise
  enables convergence checkers, documentation should explicitly describe
  and provide examples of use with and without convergence checkers.*
- [**BS1.5**]{#BS1_5} *For Bayesian Software which implements or otherwise
  enables multiple convergence checkers, differences between these should be 
  explicitly tested.*


### Input Data Structures and Validation

This section contains standards primarily intended to ensure that input data,
including model specifications, are validated prior to passing through to the
main computational algorithms.

#### Input Data

Bayesian Software is commonly designed to accept generic one- or
two-dimensional forms such as vector, matrix, or `data.frame` objects, for
which the following standard applies.


- [**BS2.1**]{#BS2_1} *Bayesian Software should implement pre-processing
  routines to ensure all input data is dimensionally commensurate, for example
  by ensuring commensurate lengths of vectors or numbers of rows of tabular
  inputs.*
    - [**BS2.1a**]{#BS2_1a} *The effects of such routines should be tested.*

#### Prior Distributions, Model Specifications, and  Distributional Parameters

The second set of standards in this section concern specification of prior
distributions, model structures, or other equivalent ways of specifying
hypothesised relationships among input data structures. R already has a diverse
range of Bayesian Software with distinct approaches to this task, commonly
either through specifying a model as a character vector representing an R
function, or an external file either as R code, or encoded according to some
alternative system (such as for [`rstan`](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/)).

Bayesian Software should:

- [**BS2.2**]{#BS2_2} *Ensure that all appropriate validation and
  pre-processing of distributional parameters are implemented as distinct
  pre-processing steps prior to submitting to analytic routines, and especially
  prior to submitting to multiple parallel computational chains.*
- [**BS2.3**]{#BS2_3} *Ensure that lengths of vectors of distributional
  parameters are
  checked, with no excess values silently discarded (unless such output is
  explicitly suppressed, as detailed below).*
- [**BS2.4**]{#BS2_4} *Ensure that lengths of vectors of distributional
  parameters are
  commensurate with expected model input (see example immediately below)*
- [**BS2.5**]{#BS2_5} *Where possible, implement pre-processing checks to
  validate
  appropriateness of numeric values submitted for distributional parameters;
  for example, by ensuring that distributional parameters defining second-order
  moments such as distributional variance or shape parameters, or any
  parameters which are logarithmically transformed, are non-negative.*

The following example demonstrates how standards like the above (BS2.4-2.5)
might be addressed. Consider the following function which defines a
log-likelihood estimator for a linear regression, controlled via a vector of
three distributional parameters, `p`:

``` r
ll <- function (x, y, p) dnorm (y - (p[1] + x * p[2]), sd = p[3], log = TRUE)
```

Pre-processing stages should be used to determine:

1. That the dimensions of the input data, `x` and `y`, are commensurate (BS2.1);
   non-commensurate inputs should error by default.
2. The length of the vector `p` (BS2.3)

The latter task is not necessarily straightforward, because the definition of
the function, `ll()`, will itself generally be part of the input to an actual
Bayesian Software function. This functional input thus needs to be examined to
determine expected lengths of hyperparameter vectors. The following code
illustrates one way to achieve this, relying on utilities for parsing function
calls in R, primarily through the
[`getParseData`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/getParseData.html)
function from the `utils` package. The parse data for a function can be
extracted with the following line:
``` r
x <- getParseData (parse (text = deparse (ll)))
```
The object `x` is a `data.frame` of every R token (such as an expression,
symbol, or operator) parsed from the function `ll`. The following section
illustrates how this data can be used to determine the expected lengths of
vector inputs to the function, `ll()`.

<p>

Input arguments used to define parameter vectors in any R software are accessed
through R's standard vector access syntax of `vec[i]`, for some element `i` of
a vector `vec`. The parse data for such begins with the `SYMBOL` of `vec`, the
`[`, a `NUM_CONST` for the value of `i`, and a closing `]`. The following code
can be used to extract elements of the parse data which match this pattern, and
ultimately to extract the various values of `i` used to access members of
`vec`.

``` r
vector_length <- function (x, i) {
    xn <- x [which (x$token %in% c ("SYMBOL", "NUM_CONST", "'['", "']'")), ]
    # split resultant data.frame at first "SYMBOL" entry
    xn <- split (xn, cumsum (xn$token == "SYMBOL"))
    # reduce to only those matching the above pattern
    xn <- xn [which (vapply (xn, function (j)
                             j$text [1] == i & nrow (j) > 3,
                             logical (1)))]
    ret <- NA_integer_ # default return value
    if (length (xn) > 0) {
        # get all values of NUM_CONST as integers
        n <- vapply (xn, function (j)
                         as.integer (j$text [j$token == "NUM_CONST"] [1]),
                         integer (1), USE.NAMES = FALSE)
        # and return max of these
        ret <- max (n)
    }
    return (ret)
}
```

That function can then be used to determine the length of any inputs which are
used as hyperparameter vectors:

``` r
ll <- function (p, x, y) dnorm (y - (p[1] + x * p[2]), sd = p[3], log = TRUE)
p <- parse (text = deparse (ll))
x <- utils::getParseData (p)

# extract the names of the parameters:
params <- unique (x$text [x$token == "SYMBOL"])
lens <- vapply (params, function (i) vector_length (x, i), integer (1))
lens
#>  y  p  x 
#> NA  3 NA
```

And the vector `p` is used as a hyperparameter vector containing three
parameters. Any initial value vectors can then be examined to ensure that they
have this same length.

Not all Bayesian Software is designed to accept model inputs expressed as
R code. The [`rstan` package](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan), for example,
implements its own model specification language, and only allows distributional
parameters to be named, and not addressed by index. While this largely avoids
problems of mismatched lengths of parameter vectors, the software (at v2.21.1)
does not ensure the existence of named parameters prior to starting the
computational chains. This ultimately results in each chain generating an error
when a model specification refers to a non-existent or undefined
distributional parameter. Such controls should be part of a single
pre-processing stage, and so should only generate a single error.


#### Computational Parameters

Computational parameters are considered here distinct from distributional
parameters, and commonly passed to Bayesian functions to directly control
computational processes. They typically include parameters controlling lengths
of runs, lengths of burn-in periods, numbers of parallel computations, other
parameters controlling how samples are to be generated, or convergence
criteria. All Computational Parameters should be checked for general "sanity"
prior to calling primary computational algorithms. The standards for such
sanity checks include that Bayesian Software should:

- [**BS2.6**]{#BS2_6} *Check that values for computational parameters lie
  within plausible ranges.*

While admittedly not always possible to define, plausible ranges may be as
simple as ensuring values are greater than zero. Where possible, checks should
nevertheless ensure appropriate responses to extremely large values, for
example by issuing diagnostic messages about likely long computational times.
The following two sub-sections consider particular cases of computational
parameters.

#### Parameters Controlling Start Values

Bayesian software generally relies on sequential random sampling procedures,
with each sequence uniquely determined by (among other aspects) the value at
which it is started. Given that, Bayesian software should:

- [**BS2.7**]{#BS2_7} *Enable starting values to be explicitly controlled via
  one or more input parameters, including multiple values for software which
  implements or enables multiple computational "chains."*
- [**BS2.8**]{#BS2_8} *Enable results of previous runs to be used as starting
  points for
  subsequent runs.*

Bayesian Software which implements or enables multiple computational chains
should:

- [**BS2.9**]{#BS2_9} *Ensure each chain is started with a different seed by
  default.*
- [**BS2.10**]{#BS2_10} *Issue diagnostic messages when identical seeds are
  passed to distinct
  computational chains.*
- [**BS2.11**]{#BS2_11} *Software which accepts starting values as a vector
  should provide
  the parameter with a plural name: for example, "starting_values" and not
  "starting_value".*

To avoid potential confusion between separate parameters to control random
seeds and starting values, we recommended a single "starting values" rather
than "seeds" argument, with appropriate translation of these parameters into
seeds where necessary.

#### Output Verbosity

All Bayesian Software should implement computational parameters to control
output verbosity. Bayesian computations are often time-consuming, and often
performed as batch computations. The following standards should be adhered to
in regard to output verbosity:

- [**BS2.12**]{#BS2_12} *Bayesian Software should implement at least one
  parameter controlling the verbosity of output, defaulting to verbose output
  of all appropriate messages, warnings, errors, and progress indicators.*
- [**BS2.13**]{#BS2_13} *Bayesian Software should enable suppression of
  messages and progress
  indicators, while retaining verbosity of warnings and errors. This should be
  tested.*
- [**BS2.14**]{#BS2_14} *Bayesian Software should enable suppression of
  warnings where
  appropriate. This should be tested.*
- [**BS2.15**]{#BS2_15} *Bayesian Software should explicitly enable errors to
  be caught, and
  appropriately processed either through conversion to warnings, or otherwise
  captured in return values. This should be tested.*


### Pre-processing and Data Transformation

#### Missing Values

In additional to the *General Standards* for missing values
(**G2.13**--**2.16**), and in particular **G2.13**, Bayesian Software should:

- [**BS3.0**]{#BS3_0} *Explicitly document assumptions made in regard to
  missing values; for example that data is assumed to contain no missing (`NA`,
  `Inf`) values, and that such values, or entire rows including any such
  values, will be automatically removed from input data.*

#### Perfect Collinearity

Where appropriate, Bayesian Software should:

- [**BS3.1**]{#BS3_1} *Implement pre-processing routines to diagnose perfect
  collinearity, and provide appropriate diagnostic messages or warnings*
- [**BS3.2**]{#BS3_2} *Provide distinct routines for processing perfectly
  collinear data, potentially bypassing sampling algorithms*

An appropriate test for **BS3.2** would confirm that `system.time()` or
equivalent timing expressions for perfectly collinear data should be *less*
than equivalent routines called with non-collinear data. Alternatively, a test
could ensure that perfectly collinear data passed to a function with a stopping
criteria generated no results, while specifying a fixed number of iterations
may generate results.

### Analytic Algorithms

As mentioned, analytic algorithms for Bayesian Software are commonly algorithms
to simulate posterior distributions, and to draw samples from those
simulations. Numerous extant R packages implement and offer sampling
algorithms, and not all Bayesian Software will internally implement sampling
algorithms. The following standards apply to packages which do implement
internal sampling algorithms:


- [**BS4.0**]{#BS4_0} *Packages should document sampling algorithms (generally
  via literary citation, or reference to other software)*
- [**BS4.1**]{#BS4_1} *Packages should provide explicit comparisons with
  external samplers
  which demonstrate intended advantage of implementation (generally via tests,
  vignettes, or both).*

Regardless of whether or not Bayesian Software implements internal sampling
algorithms, it should:

- **BS4.2** *Implement at least one means to validate posterior estimates.*

An example of posterior validation is the [Simulation Based
Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06788) approach implemented in the
[`rstan`](https://mc-stan.org/rstan) function
[`sbc`](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/reference/sbc.html)). (Note also that the
[`BayesValidate` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesValidate) has
not been updated for almost 15 years, so should not be directly used, although
ideas from that package may be adapted for validation purposes.) Beyond this,
where possible or applicable, Bayesian Software should:

- [**BS4.3**]{#BS4_3} *Implement or otherwise offer at least one type of
  convergence checker, and provide a documented reference for that
  implementation.*
- [**BS4.4**]{#BS4_4} *Enable computations to be stopped on convergence
  (although not
  necessarily by default).*
- [**BS4.5**]{#BS4_5} *Ensure that appropriate mechanisms are provided for
  models which do not
  converge.*

This is often achieved by having default behaviour to stop after specified
numbers of iterations regardless of convergence.

- [**BS4.6**]{#BS4_6} *Implement tests to confirm that results with convergence
  checker are statistically equivalent to results from equivalent fixed number
  of samples without convergence checking.*
- [**BS4.7**]{#BS4_7} *Where convergence checkers are themselves parametrised,
  the effects of
  such parameters should also be tested. For threshold parameters, for example,
  lower values should result in longer sequence lengths.*


### Return Values

Unlike software in many other categories, Bayesian Software should generally
return several kinds of distinct data, both the raw data derived from
statistical algorithms, and associated metadata. Such distinct and generally
disparate forms of data will be generally best combined into a single object
through implementing a defined class structure, although other options are
possible, including (re-)using extant class structures (see the CRAN Task view
on [Bayesian Inference](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html) for
reference to other packages and class systems). Regardless of the precise form
of return object, and whether or not defined class structures are used or
implemented, the following standards apply:

- [**BS5.0**]{#BS5_0} *Return values should include starting value(s) or
  seed(s), including values for each sequence where multiple sequences are
  included*
- [**BS5.1**]{#BS5_1} *Return values should include appropriate metadata on
  types (or
  classes) and dimensions of input data*

The latter standard may also include returning a unique hash computed from the
input data, to enable results to be uniquely associated with that input data.
With regard to the input function, or alternative means of specifying prior
distributions:

- [**BS5.2**]{#BS5_2} *Bayesian Software should either return the input
  function or prior distributional specification in the return object; or
  enable direct access to such via additional functions which accept the return
  object as single argument.*

Where convergence checkers are implemented or provided:

- [**BS5.3**]{#BS5_3} *Bayesian Software should return convergence statistics
  or equivalent*
- [**BS5.4**]{#BS5_4} *Where multiple checkers are enabled, Bayesian Software
  should return details of convergence checker used*
- [**BS5.5**]{#BS5_5} *Appropriate diagnostic statistics to indicate absence of
  convergence should either be returned or immediately able to be accessed.*

### Additional Functionality

With regard to additional methods implemented for, or dispatched on, return
objects:

- [**BS6.0**]{#BS6_0} *Software should implement a default `print` method for
  return objects*
- [**BS6.1**]{#BS6_1} *Software should implement a default `plot` method for
  return
  objects*
- [**BS6.2**]{#BS6_2} *Software should provide and document straightforward
  abilities to
  plot sequences of posterior samples, with burn-in periods clearly
  distinguished*
- [**BS6.3**]{#BS6_3} *Software should provide and document straightforward
  abilities to plot posterior distributional estimates*

Beyond these points:

- [**BS6.4**]{#BS6_4} *Software may provide `summary` methods for return objects*
- [**BS6.5**]{#BS6_5} *Software may provide abilities to plot both sequences of
  posterior samples and distributional estimates together in single graphic*


### Tests

#### Parameter Recovery Tests

Bayesian software should implement the following parameter recovery tests:

- [**BS7.0**]{#BS7_0} *Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of
  parametric estimates of a prior distribution*
- [**BS7.1**]{#BS7_1} *Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of a
  prior
  distribution in the absence of any additional data or information*
- [**BS7.2**]{#BS7_2} *Software should demonstrate and confirm recovery of a
  expected posterior distribution given a specified prior and some input data*

#### Algorithmic Scaling Tests

- [**BS7.3**]{#BS7_3} *Bayesian software should include tests which demonstrate
  and confirm the scaling of algorithmic efficiency with sizes of input data.*

An example of adhering to this standard would be documentation or tests which
demonstrate or confirm that computation times increase approximately
logarithmically with increasing sizes of input data.

#### Scaling of Input to Output Data

- [**BS7.4**]{#BS7_4} *Bayesian software should implement tests which confirm
  that predicted or fitted values are on (approximately) the same scale as
  input values.*
    - [**BS7.4a**]{#BS7_4a} *The implications of any assumptions on scales on
      input objects should be explicitly tested in this context; for example
      that the scales of inputs which do not have means of zero will not be
      able to be recovered.*
